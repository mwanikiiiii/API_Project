Setting up a presentation layer to serve the API endpoints using Express. This layer defines the API routes, their respective HTTP methods, and the logic to handle incoming requests and send appropriate responses.

Implementing load balancing and caching techniques to improve scalability and reliability using  NGINX load balancer to distribute incoming requests across multiple server instances, and using  Redis caching middleware to cache frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database.
