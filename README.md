API project

Setting up a Node.js environment and install the necessary dependencies, including Express, which will serve as the web framework for the API.

Creating a database and set up a data access layer using a Node.js database driver like Sequelize or MongoDB.

Creating a business logic layer to handle the data processing and validation. This layer should contain functions that can access the database, retrieve data, and perform any necessary processing or validation before returning data to the presentation layer.

Setting up a presentation layer to serve the API endpoints using Express. This layer should define the API routes, their respective HTTP methods, and the logic to handle incoming requests and send appropriate responses.

Implementing load balancing and caching techniques to improve scalability and reliability. For example, you can use a load balancer like NGINX or HAProxy to distribute incoming requests across multiple server instances, and use caching middleware like Redis to cache frequently accessed data and reduce the load on the database.

Testing the API to ensure that it is working correctly and meets the specified requirements.
